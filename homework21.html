    <h1>Hyeon-min Lee</h1>
    <p>Let me tell you about my trip to Europe. I traveled around Europe for a month. It was the summer of 2019. I traveled with three military colleagues after I was discharged from the military. I don't remember it well, but I think the countries I went to were Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, France, and Belgium. The amazing thing about our trip is that the only thing we planned before the trip was the air ticket.</p>
    
    <p>We left without planning any travel routes, accommodation, restaurants, and so on. But we had fun traveling using Google Maps and various apps. We used the bus more than the train during our trip, because the bus was much cheaper than the train. Interestingly, unlike Korean buses, there was a toilet inside the European bus. I think it was necessary because they were a lot of long hours of operation. But the toilet smelled so bad that it was uncomfortable.</p>
    
    <p>We used the smartphones to find out where we would travel the next day. When the destination was decided, we looked for nearby restaurants and accommodations together. We were able to go to many better places than we thought. There were a lot more things going on, but it'll get too long if I talk, so I'll stop here.</p>
